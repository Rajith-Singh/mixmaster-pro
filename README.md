# MixMaster Pro â€” Cocktail Expert System

This repository contains a small Tkinter GUI that queries an embedded Prolog knowledge base (SWI-Prolog) to recommend cocktails.

Project layout (new):

- src/
  - cocktail_app/
    - __init__.py
    - __main__.py         # entrypoint (python -m cocktail_app)
    - gui.py              # main GUI code (same behavior as original)
    - knowledge/
      - cocktail_knowledge_base.pl

How to run

1. Install Python 3.8+ and ensure Tkinter is available (usually included with the standard installer).
2. Install SWI-Prolog and make sure the `swipl` executable is available on your PATH.
3. From the project root, set `src` on PYTHONPATH and run the package module:

```powershell
# from project root
$env:PYTHONPATH = "$PWD/src"; python -m cocktail_app
```

This will run the packaged GUI (`src/cocktail_app/gui.py`) without modifying the original files.

Notes

- The GUI code uses the packaged Prolog file at `src/cocktail_app/knowledge/cocktail_knowledge_base.pl`.
- The behaviour and logic of the app were preserved exactly; only package-relative paths were introduced.
